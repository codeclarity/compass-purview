## Compass Purview

### Synopisis
A collection of CSS UI (User Interface) stylesheets for Compass/SASS. Our goal is to provide an easy to use collection of "plugable" stylesheets to enhance your user experience.

As of right now, this repository and project is in it's infancy and I hope that along the way between collaboration and hard work by the Web Development Community, we will be able to provide a "one stop shop" for your UI/UX needs.

### Requirements

* Ruby
* Gems
* Compass

### Roadmap

* Version 1.0- Will include 10 different pure CSS User Interfaces. All Stylesheets will be available for Compass and SASS.
